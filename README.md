Once you have created your tasks, you now have the option of updating or deleting your tasks. You can update each task by clicking on the "Update!" button on each task, afterwhich you will be prompted twice -- once to type in a new designated title, and another time to type in a new designated description! After you have typed these in, you may click the "OK" button to move on. Your updated task will then be displayed!

Now that you have updated a task, you may also choose to delete a task! To do this, simply click the "Delete!" Button next to the task you would like to get rid of. Once you click the button, your task will disappear from the displayed task list.
